# Traveltime from Home

This project contains multiple functions

1. pathbetweenpoints: this creates a path based on the coordinates given and returns a map with the points and the route
2. Travelling salesman problem
   - Created a KNN (Nearest Neighbor) Algorithm to give an estimate for the shortest way to go to all the capital cities of the dutch provinces.
   - It uses a 2D euclidian formula to calculate a value for the distance between two places
   - It does this for every city and excluding each time cities already visited
   - In the end it will go back to the home city again
